# My-programmer-journey
In this repository, i'll be updating daily (almost) on what i did that day regarding python, or anything related to programming for that matter. My goal is to become significantly good in python within the next 6 months and grab an internship opportunity. I am planning to do many projects over the course of 6 months.
